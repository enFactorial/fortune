“It is not a good thing always to be feeling your pulse and taking your 
temperature. Although one has to do it sometimes, you do not want to make a 
habit of it. I have heard it said that a Government should keep its ear to the 
ground, but they should also remember that this is not a very dignified 
attitude.”

“[Politics does not] unfold like an arithmetical calculation on the principle 
that two and two make four. Sometimes in life they make five, or minus three, 
and sometimes the blackboard topples down in the middle of the sum and leaves 
the class in disorder and the pedagogue with a black eye. The element of the 
unexpected and the unforeseeable is what gives some of its relish to life, and 
saves us from falling into the mechanic thraldom of the logicians.”

“Embalm, bury, and cremate. Take no chances!”

A young MP, an admirer of the lord president, delivered an emotional plea for 
unilateral disarmament and was so incautious as to approach Winston in the 
smoking room and ask his opinion of it. “Why, I thought it was very good,” 
Winston replied. “It must have been good, for it contained, so far as I know, 
all the platitudes known to the human race, with the possible exceptions of 
‘Prepare to meet thy God’ and ‘Please adjust your dress before leaving.’”

Churchill had been in Parliament since 1901; he knew exactly where the line 
lay — knew, for example, of Parliament’s list of banned words, which included 
“blackguard,” “dog,” “guttersnipe,” and “swine.” One young Labour MP, unaware 
of the list, had used all these in a ferocious assault on Churchill, thereby 
deeply offending not only Winston but the entire House. Attlee took the man 
aside; he told him he would have to go to Chartwell and apologize. The 
chastened MP drove to Kent and knocked on the front door. Churchill’s valet 
answered. The man stated his name and mission and was asked to wait. Winston 
was in the toilet, moving his bowels. The valet stood in the hall outside, 
delivered his message, and waited. After a long moment Churchill said: “Tell 
him I’m on the privy and can take only one shit at a time.”

"When the situation was manageable it was neglected, and now that it is 
thoroughly out of hand, we apply too late the remedies which then might have 
effected a cure. There is nothing new in the story. It is as old as the 
Sibylline books. It falls into that long dismal catalogue of the fruitlessness 
of experience and the confirmed unteachability of mankind. Want of foresight, 
unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective, lack of clear 
thinking, confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until 
self-preservation strikes its jarring gong — these are the features which 
constitute the endless repetition of history.

Winston was guided by a built-in gyroscope which would carry him toward his

A male is lustiest at fifteen; the average female reaches the heights of 
passion in her mid-thirties. Churchill had always been a sublimator. All who 
were close to him agree that he was weakly sexed, even in youth, and in his 
sixties his volcano was virtually extinct. In Parliament a fellow MP whispered 
to him that his trousers were unfastened. “It makes no difference,” Winston 
replied wryly. “The dead bird doesn’t leave the nest.”

Churchill's plan for victory before WW2 started:
Would cut losses in Far East; no dispersion of the fleet; settle with Japan 
after the war. Central Europe mobilized as a unit in 1914. Then Germany had 
ten divisions from Czechoslovakia; now they need six to hold it. Hungary, 
Jugoslavia, Rumania, dangerous and unreliable. Poland, a new force, and behind 
it the Russian pad. No use to say to Germany they are not being encircled. 
Better to overwhelm them with righteous indignation. Only argument that counts 
is force. No use shaping policy in accordance with Goebbels’ propaganda. Take 
your own line and make them follow. In event of German mobilization, mobilize 
fleet; at first provocative action, cut German railway communication with 
Europe and defy them to do anything about it.

The present is never tidy, or certain, or reasonable, and those who try to make 
it so, once it has become the past, succeed only in making it seem implausible. 
Among the perceptive observations and shrewd conclusions of the Churchills and 
Sargents were clutters of other reports and forecasts, completely at odds with 
them. All of it, the prescient and the cockeyed, always arrives in a 
promiscuous rush, and most men in power, sorting through it, believe what they 
want to believe, accepting whatever justifies their policies and convictions 
while taking out insurance, whenever possible, against the possibility that the 
truth may lie in their wastebaskets.

[Molotov] was “a man of outstanding ability and cold-blooded ruthlessness. He 
had survived the fearful hazards and ordeals to which all the Bolshevik leaders 
had been subjected in the years of triumphant revolution. . . . His cannonball 
head, black mustache, and comprehending eyes, his slab face, his verbal 
adroitness and imperturbable demeanour, were appropriate manifestations of his 
qualities and skill. He was above all men fitted to be the agent and instrument 
of the policy of an incalculable machine. . . . I have never seen a human being 
who more perfectly represented the modern conception of a robot.”

Tanks were replacing horses, and at heart [Winston] remained a young officer of 
hussars. In a nostalgic chamber of his mind, Victorian colonial wars, with 
their negligible casualties — negligible, that is, for the British — would 
always glitter. He rejoiced in the memory of magnificence and turned away from 
the squalid, forgetting that the only moral judgments in war are made by the 
victors, and victorious armies are led by those who have mastered the latest, 
most efficient tools of their trade

Pim’s assignment was formidable. Thousands of merchantmen flew the red ensign, 
feeding and arming England, and at any given moment at least half of them were 
at sea. Pim recalled how, when he believed the war room was ready, he sent word 
to the first lord. “Very good,” said Churchill after inspecting it, “but the 
maps will all have to be replaced. When you know me better you will know that I 
only paint in pastel shades, and those strong colours under the lamps would 
give me and you a headache.”
