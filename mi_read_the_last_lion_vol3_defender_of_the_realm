During a meeting at Admiralty House, he lifted one that wasn’t, and said: “This

Ironically, the Old Man’s extraordinary fluency in discussion was sometimes a 
handicap. He could out-argue anyone, even when he was wrong. All who were close 
to him remember what Sir Ian Jacob (then a colonel, later promoted to 
lieutenant general)calls his “most devastating method of argument.” Jacob 
recalled how he would “debate, browbeat, badger, and cajole those who were 
opposed to him, or whose work was under discussion.”

Once years before, recalled Inspector Thompson, during a train journey in North 
Africa, Churchill (then a cabinet member) decided he wanted a bath. He ordered 
the train stopped. Then he ordered a tub he had spotted in the baggage car 
removed and set out in the sands. It was filled to brimming with hot water 
siphoned from the locomotive’s boiler. And there, as the train let off steam, 
Churchill “bathed with half of Africa agape.” It fell to Thompson to shadow 
Churchill when he made his ruthless breaks. “He will move at a moment’s notice. 
He will move without notice. He is an animal. In war he is particularly feral.”

He loved to engage in scientific and technological speculation, intellectual 
realms where the imagination could soar and where ideas were tested, results 
obtained, and improvements made in the lives of people. In 1932 he published 
Thoughts and Adventures, a collection of essays in which he predicted the 
atomic bomb and atomic-powered electrification (and the risks to humanity); 
bioengineering of crops and animals (and perhaps people); and television 
(which, when it became a reality, he detested). “Projects undreamed-of by past 
generations will absorb our immediate descendants,” he wrote, “comforts, 
activities, amenities, pleasures will crowd upon them, but their hearts will 
ache, and their lives will be barren, if they have not a vision above material 
things.”

Churchill squeezed the present for all it was worth. He believed meaning is 
found only in the present, for the past is gone and the future looms 
indeterminate if it arrives at all. Churchill was an old trooper who, whether 
at his easel, speaking in the Commons, or dining with his cronies, manifested 
the soldier’s creed: savor the moment, for it may be the last. [...] In his 
book Reade attributed to history a Darwinian, a survival of the fittest, 
continuum. Churchill, paraphrasing Reade in a letter to his mother, wrote, “If 
the human race ever reaches a stage of development—when religion will cease to 
assist and comfort mankind—Christianity will be put aside as a crutch which is 
no longer needed, and man will stand erect on the firm legs of reason.”

one evening later in the war he recited to his guests a Soviet creed:

	Lenin was hungry, therefore I can go hungry…”

Byron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage was a Churchill favorite, although he did 
not share Byron’s melancholic view that man’s greatest tragedy is his ability 
to conceive a perfection that he cannot attain. Rather, Churchill told his 
countrymen in the battle against Hitler, “If we can stand up to him, all 
Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, 
sunlit uplands.” “Invictus,” a nineteenth-century ode to willpower by 
William Ernest Henley, was another Churchill favorite.

The isolationist argument was simple, and inflexible. Britain’s plight did not 
much move isolationists, because they saw Britain as everything America strove

at home. Could this realm, this distant island, this England, even be properly

Hitler’s decision was equivalent to Roosevelt taking over day-to-day operations 
from Marshall, or Churchill supplanting Brooke. But whereas a peevish Hitler 
squelched dissent, Churchill (himself often peevish) fostered an 
often-fractious give-and-take between himself and his generals, with the result 
that decisions taken were made stronger by having been annealed in the furnace 
of debate. Hitler’s takeover of the army apparatus not only banked the fires of 
debate, but further fractured his chain of command and set up fiefdoms within 
the German armed forces, each reporting to Hitler but not to the others, such 
that Hitler and Hitler alone was privy to all information. He thus deprived 
himself of the unified and coherent counsel of the experts who could best 
counsel him.

Churchill and Roosevelt understood they must accommodate each other much like 
partners in a three-legged race, where individual mobility and strengths are 
subordinated to the common cause. Disparate strategic goals, political and 
military, must not be allowed to undermine the common cause. They understood 
that for the duration they could not exploit each other’s weaknesses, as they 
might in a friendly rivalry over tariffs. They knew they had to act as one and 
speak as one, because both their foe in Berlin and their new friend in Moscow 
were absolute masters of exploiting weakness.

The times were great for Churchill not because his England was winning—it most 
decidedly was not—but because England was fighting Germany, and now Japan, to 
the death. Yet, Mollie Panter-Downes wrote that month, that although Britons 
trusted Churchill in the past because he had always told them the truth, 
“there’s an uneasy suspicion that fine oratory may carry away the orator as 
well as the audience.” By February Churchill understood that, which is why he 
now promised only more sacrifice, more defeats, and more hard times, promises 
he delivered on.

The delta had for five decades supplied Bengal enough rice to stave off want; 
no major famine had occurred in India for more than fifty years, in part 
because of the relationship between the Burmese rice surpluses and Bengal’s 
needs. The Japanese broke that connection, stealing the Irrawaddy’s bounty for 
Tokyo’s consumption and destroying what they couldn’t steal. The delta’s loss, 
along with unprecedented cyclones in Bengal later in the year and a worsening 
drought on the upper Subcontinent, guaranteed rising prices and grain and rice 
shortages in Bengal, whether or not Japanese troops arrived there anytime soon.

Unfamiliar with the jargon of airmen, he noted in his diary that he slept well 
“after paying a visit to the pilot in his driving compartment on top bridge.” 
All aboard were bemused by the fact that their watches, as they crossed time 
zones, no longer kept time with the sun. Brooke consulted his watch to 
determine when in “real time” he might take breakfast. Churchill consulted 
neither the sun nor his watch but his stomach. For the duration of the war on 
such journeys Churchill took his meals on “stomach-time” regardless of what his 
timepiece or the sun told him. Tommy Thompson recalled that on that voyage, as 
the flying boat neared the American coast, the passengers discussed “the 
advisability of having lunch or high tea before arrival.” The question was put 
to Churchill, who “settled it with a flat statement that it was time for ‘high 
whisky.’ ”

Churchill later wrote that valuable lessons were learned at Dieppe, that the

a debacle like Dieppe to learn the lessons; they were paid to plan, not to

violated were well known, including by Churchill, who in this case did not pay 
his usual attention to the smallest of details. The raid was a complete 
failure, and the many lives sacrificed in attempting it were lost with no

The British people, for the most part, accepted blacks in their midst more 
readily than did the Americans, especially American officers, all of whom were 
white and many of whom refused to dine in restaurants that served blacks. 
British villagers were especially welcoming of the blacks. One pub owner, 
disgusted by the behavior of white Americans, placed a sign in his window: “For 
the use of the British and coloured Americans only.” But in London, to placate 
white Yanks (who were flush with dollars), many restaurants banned black 
Americans, and by doing so inadvertently closed the doors on British citizens. 
When a black official from the Colonial Office was refused service at his 
favorite restaurant after American officers complained to the proprietor, the 
repercussions reached all the way to the cabinet, where, after pondering the 
incident, Churchill commented, “That’s all right, if he brings a banjo they’ll

Something other than precise analysis affected Churchill’s opinions of all 
peoples other than English-speaking. He shared with the Western press and much 
of the English-speaking world a condescending attitude toward people who were 
of other than Anglo-Saxon ancestry. Churchill’s memos, his dinner-table asides, 
even his public addresses, are rife with references to Japs, Wops, Frogs, and 
Huns, often modified with such choice adjectives as “foul,” “filthy,” 
“wretched,” and “nasty.” His friends, family, and colleagues expressed 
themselves likewise: Sir Alexander Cadogan’s diary entries are xenophobic 
romps, peppered with demeaning references to just about everybody of any 
nationality other than English—this from the permanent secretary of the Foreign 
Office, responsible during the war for vetting the legal niceties of Britain’s 
foreign affairs, including the wording of the Atlantic Charter, parent document 
to the United Nations. Cadogan considered the Slavs to be “poor dears,” the 
Iraqis “filthy,” and the Japanese “monkeys.” The usually polite and progressive 
Harold Nicolson referred to “the Japanese” when he contemplated Japan in his 
diary, until, that is, Japan began trouncing the British in Asia, after which 
Nicolson wrote of the “monkey men.” Lord Cherwell despised Jews. Even 
Clementine could demean with the best of them. In a late 1941 letter to 
Winston, who at the time was America-bound on board the Duke of York, 
Clementine wrote words of encouragement: “Well my beloved Winston—May God keep 
you and inspire you to make good plans with the president. It’s a horrible 
World at present, Europe over-run by the Nazi hogs, & the Far East by yellow 
Japanese lice…. Tender Love & thoughts, Clemmie.” Such were the times.

The First Lady therefore arrived in England during a difficult period for race 
relations. Normally, she would have spoken her mind. But to the relief of 
Secretary of War Stimson, her behavior in Britain was “very temperate.” She was 
there to improve morale, not to reform the armed forces. Speaking her mind to 
Churchill was another matter. When, during a dinner at No. 10, the First Lady 
took him to task for first backing Franco and then, after Franco showed his 
Fascist stripes, not backing the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War, 
Churchill growled that had the Loyalists won, the first heads to roll would 
belong to people such as herself and her husband. Mrs. Roosevelt responded by 
saying she didn’t care whether she lost her head. “Well,” Churchill snarled, 
“I don’t want to lose mine.” Clementine did not help matters when she offered 
that Mrs. Roosevelt was correct. As Churchill fumed, Clementine separated the 
combatants, announcing that it was time for the ladies to adjourn to the 
sitting room and leave the men alone with their brandies and cigars. Of her 
dining experiences with Churchill, Mrs. Roosevelt later wrote, “I found the

On November 10, 1942, Churchill delivered two of his most memorable lines while 
addressing the traditional Lord Mayor’s dinner at Mansion House [...]. 
Referring to Montgomery’s desert victory, Churchill cautioned, “Now this is not

of the beginning.”

“Let me, however, make this clear... We mean to hold our own. I have not become 
the King’s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the 
British Empire.” In uttering those words Churchill appeared to have confirmed 
for critics, then and since, his status as an outdated imperialist who either 
could not see or could not abide a simple truth—the age of European colonialism 
was just about over, its expiration aided and abetted by Franklin Roosevelt. 
Yet Churchill’s next line, infrequently noted, completed his thought: “For that 
task, if it were prescribed, someone else would have to be found, and under

[...]
Churchill, peering backward though history, grasped the ultimate mortality of 
empires, all save the British Empire, which functioned as a parliamentary 
democracy, a fact that for Churchill justified—demanded—its continuance. He 
once told Colville that the one great lesson he had learned from his father was 
that “the British alone had managed to combine Empire and Liberty.” There were 
inequalities, to be sure, and he wanted them rectified. He told Attlee that the 
old order was changing and the “pomp and vanity must go.” He told Eden that in 
Egypt “too many fat, insolent and party interests had grown up under our 
protection” and that in time the rich pashas and landowners would have to pay 
taxes at the rates paid by the wealthy in Britain, which rates Churchill 
intended to keep high in order that the financial burden of the war did not 
fall unfairly on Britain’s working class.

Churchill believed that the diaspora of English-speaking peoples that had taken 
place since the sixteenth century had resulted in an empire unique in history, 
an empire, he wrote, “based on Government by consent and the voluntary 
association of autonomous states under the Crown.” He was one with Aristotle: 
rule shows the man—to which could be added, rule shows the nation. His was an 
empire of shared democratic ideals, shared risks, and shared rewards. It was a 
nation, the mightiest oak in the forest of nations, yet it cast a beneficent 
shadow in which less civilized peoples might find shelter and grow.

The great Bismarck—for there were once great men in Germany—is said to have 
observed towards the close of his life that the most potent factor in human 
society at the end of the nineteenth century was the fact that the British and 
American peoples spoke the same language. That was a pregnant saying. Certainly 
it has enabled us to wage war together with an intimacy and harmony never 
before achieved among allies. The gift of a common tongue is a priceless 
inheritance and it may well some day become the foundation of a common 
citizenship. I like to think of British and Americans moving about freely over 
each other’s wide estates with hardly a sense of being foreigners to one 
another... All these are great possibilities, and I say: “Let us go into this 
together. Let us have another Boston Tea Party about it.
Let us go forward as with other matters and other measures similar in aim and 
effect—let us go forward in malice to none and good will to all. Such plans 
offer far better prizes than taking away other people’s provinces or lands or

He soon realized under fire in combat that a dash of faith offered some comfort. 
The result was typical Churchill: “I therefore adapted quite early in life a 
system of believing whatever I wanted to believe.” His meager relationship with 
God was neither reverential nor deferential, but one that reflected Stanley 
Baldwin’s political philosophy: “Never complain and never explain.” He did not

with supplications for divine blessing. He did not ask Providence for the 
strength or wisdom to win the war. He told Britons, “As long as we have faith 
in our cause and unconquerable will power, salvation will not be denied us.”

Late one evening in Tehran, he told Stalin, “I believe God is on our side. At 
least I have done my best to make Him a faithful ally.” Stalin grinned, and 
replied, “And the devil is on my side. Because, of course, everyone knows the 
devil is a Communist and God, no doubt, is a good Conservative.” That was 
Churchill playing the straight man to Stalin. He did so again when (as told by 
Jan Smuts) he suggested the pope might play some role in securing the peace. 
“The Pope,” Stalin replied thoughtfully, “the Pope. How many divisions has 
he?” Stalin, Churchill noted with irony, seemed to bring up God quite 
frequently in conversation.

Churchill’s scant theological leanings tended to incline toward Spinoza’s 
hands-off deity: God helps those who help themselves. Providence may have put 
him—and Cromwell, Marlborough, Pitt, and Nelson—on earth, but Providence 
disclosed no plan for success, and offered no guidance or revelation. Churchill 
guided himself.
Thus, while his wife and daughter and colleagues beheld the white Christmas 
dove and were moved to quiet contemplation and wonder, Churchill, in bed with 
his dispatch boxes, cigars, and whisky, found guidance in his maps and plotted 
the course of his armies.

Then, instead of striking inland, the men sat static on the Anzio beaches for 
two days. And that was the problem. With their backs to the sea and six 
divisions’ worth of German reinforcements rushing from northern Italy to their 
front, the Allies found themselves ripe targets for the German 88s hastily dug 
into hillsides above and around the beach. By January 28, Churchill knew the 
invasion had failed. He famously described the situation a few weeks later when 
he told Colville and Brooke, “I thought we should fling wildcat ashore and all 
we got was an old stranded whale on the beach.”

The fault for that, as Churchill saw it, lay with the American commander, 
General John P. Lucas. He came, he saw, he consulted, and as a result, his men 
died. Kesselring, in contrast, deployed his forces with precision. Yet Sir 
John Keegan sided with Lucas in a critical regard: “Had Lucas risked rushing at 
Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they 
would have soon been crushed.”

Roosevelt sifted all questions of Italy, Poland, and Ireland in terms of 
election year politics—Italian, Irish, and Polish Americans formed the backbone 
of his constituency. On the one hand, he did not want to lose the Polish bloc; 
on the other, he did not want Stalin doubting the sincerity of the agreements 
made at Tehran with regard to Poland. For his part, Churchill examined Poland 
strictly in terms of Britain’s commitment to the Free Poles. He considered 
other European countries—Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria—largely 
in terms of their susceptibility to Communist takeover. Upon Ireland, where he 
expected mischief, he kept a wary eye. Indeed, late in the year de Valera 
proclaimed Ireland’s duty and right as a neutral to offer sanctuary to Germans 
accused of war crimes. Where Roosevelt weighed issues regarding Europe in terms 
of American politics, Churchill weighed them in terms of Europe, its future, 
and Britain’s role in that future. Stalin, likewise, weighed matters in terms 
of Russia’s role in postwar Europe. His armies were now inside Poland, or as 
Roosevelt pointed out to Polish Americans throughout the year, inside one of 
the many configurations of Poland that had come and gone for over a century. He 
asked, which was the real Poland? His point was, Poland defied geographical 
definition, which even the American Polish community admitted was true.

Then Stalin announced he could no longer communicate with Churchill on the 
matter because their correspondence was regularly leaked to the press by the 
British. In fact, the Soviet embassy was the source of the leaks. Stalin 
further mucked up the works when he permitted Pravda to run a story that 
claimed the British were in secret peace negotiations with Berlin, a charge 
that prompted Churchill to proclaim to Brooke, “Trying to maintain good 
relations with a communist is like wooing a crocodile…. When it opens its mouth 
you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile, or preparing to eat you up.” By 
mid-March, Churchill concluded that his efforts to forge a Polish-Soviet 
agreement had failed and that he soon would have to “make a cold announcement 
to Parliament” on the matter. “It all seems to augur ill,” Colville told his 
diary on March 18, “for the future of relations between this country and the 
U.S.S.R.”

Man lamented to Colville that “this world (‘this dusty and lamentable ball’) is

to live.” Yet, as always, he remained cautiously optimistic. On April 1 he 
wrote to Roosevelt of Stalin’s belligerency, “I have a feeling the bark may be 
worse than its bite.”

Beyond Europe, the British were no longer masters of the fate of hundreds of 
millions of subjects throughout the Empire. This was underscored in early June 
when Churchill received a reply from Roosevelt to his desperate plea for 
American shipping to relieve the “grievous famine in Bengal.” More than seven 
hundred thousand Bengalis had died since early 1943, in large part because the 
Japanese controlled Burma and its surplus rice. Churchill informed Roosevelt 
that although 350,000 tons of surplus Australian wheat was available, the ships 
to carry it were not. Could the president supply the ships? After waiting more 
than four weeks, Roosevelt replied in the negative, and with “regret.” He cited 
the effect of such a “diversion” on military operations. Churchill—and King 
George and London—could do almost nothing for the Bengalis; at least a million 
more died during the next twelve months.

Edmund Burke wrote that empires die for a number of reasons, including the 
inability to govern disparate peoples in far-flung lands. Churchill possessed 
the will to save His Majesty’s Empire, and to guarantee the peace in Europe, 
but he lacked the way. Despite the staggering losses the British had sustained 
since 1939, despite their sacrifice and their refusal to give in when they 
fought alone, the peace, when it came, would be Stalin’s to violate. With the 
Americans in their ascendancy, the solution to containing a belligerent Stalin 
no longer rested with London. For better or worse, it rested with Washington. 
And Franklin Roosevelt had just made his thoughts clear on that subject.
Sometime in 1944, a new word crept into the lexicon of international politics: 
“superpower.” It was not coined with the British Empire in mind.

On March 27 Churchill pleaded with Roosevelt to join him in taking a firm stand 
against Stalin on the Polish question:
"As you know, if we fail altogether to get a satisfactory solution on Poland, 
and are in fact defrauded by Russia, both Eden and I are pledged to report the 
fact openly to the House of Commons. There I advised critics of the Yalta 
settlement to trust Stalin. If I have to make statement of facts to the House, 
the whole world will draw the deduction that such advice was wrong…. Surely we 
must not be manoeuvered into becoming parties to imposing on Poland, and on 
much more of Eastern Europe, the Russian version of democracy?… There seems to 
be only one possible alternative to confessing our total failure. That 
alternative is to stand by our interpretation of the Yalta declaration."

“I am astounded that Stalin should have addressed to you a message so insulting 
to the honour of the United States and also Great Britain…. All this makes it 
the more important that we should join hands with the Russian army as far to 
the east as possible, and if circumstances allow, enter Berlin.” But Roosevelt 
had already rejected that strategy. Churchill added: “If they [the Russians] 
are ever convinced that we are afraid of them and can be bullied into 
submission, then indeed I shall despair of our future relations with them, and 
much more.”

Brian Gardner, writing in Churchill in Power, called the statement “perhaps the 
most gracious acceptance of democratic defeat in the English language.” Churchill:
"The decision of the British people has been recorded in the votes counted 
today. I have therefore laid down the charge which was placed upon me in darker 
times. I regret that I have not been permitted to finish the work against Japan…. 
It only remains for me to express to the British people, for whom I have acted 
in these perilous years, my profound gratitude for the unflinching, unswerving 
support which they have given me during my task, and for the many expressions 
of kindness which they have shown towards their servant.”

record if, after our fourteen months’ time limit, we allow one fifth of the 
population of the globe, occupying a region nearly as large as Europe, to fall

with destiny”—India and Pakistan gained their independence. In coming months, 
more than seven million Hindus fled Pakistan for India, and a like number of 
Muslims fled India for Pakistan. At least five hundred thousand Hindus and 
Muslims were slaughtered in the Punjab alone, the responsibility for which, 
Churchill told the House, rested with the Socialist government. In late 
October, India and Pakistan went to war over Kashmir. On January 30, 1948, a 
Hindu extremist murdered Mohandas Gandhi, who shared with Churchill a vision 
of a united India and the end of the caste system.

One such was at Huddersfield, where Lady Violet Bonham Carter—daughter of the 
great prime minister H. H. Asquith—ran as a Liberal. She and Churchill had been 
best of friends since first meeting at a dinner party in 1906, when he was 
thirty-two and she nineteen. She later wrote that Churchill “seemed to me to be 
quite different from any other young man I had ever met.” Churchill did not 
appear to notice her at first. When he did, he abruptly asked her age. She gave 
it. “ ‘And I,’ he said almost despairingly, ‘am thirty-two already, younger 
than anyone else who counts, though.’ Then savagely: ‘Curse ruthless time. 
Curse our mortality. How cruelly short is the allotted span for all we must 
cram in.’ ” He then proceeded on a long discourse on the shortness of human 
life and the vast potential for human accomplishment, at the end of which he 
announced, “We are all worms, but I do believe that I am a glow worm.”

Churchill had spent his entire life creating an identity from his own audacious 
imagination, which, as Oscar Wilde observed, was the best way to get through 
life without suffering through it all. Churchill had made his dream a reality; 
he had imagined himself into Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, the 
greatest statesman of the twentieth century. He had fought the 
monster—Hitler—without himself becoming a monster. He had prevailed on his 
countrymen during his final year at No. 10 to build the hydrogen bomb, in 
order to keep the Soviet dictators behind their Iron Curtain. Yet by 1958, new 
ages and new generations—the atomic, the space, the beat, the rock and roll, 
the television—had overtaken and bypassed Sir Winston. With no further role to 
play in history’s unfolding, he became a spectator.
